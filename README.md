## Inspiration: Meet Wazeera from Tribal Area of Pakistan. 

45 years old diabetes patient
Doctors recommended that she should perform aerobic exercise regularly. Aerobic activity bouts should ideally last at least 10 min, with the goal of âˆ¼30 min/day or more, most days of the week for adults with type 2 diabetes.
